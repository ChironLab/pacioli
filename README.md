## What is it?

It is an open source project to build a simple accounting system for small businesses and freelancers. Keep in mind that this is an accounting software, NOT billing, NOT CRM, NOT expense tracking. It is meant to provide a simple interface to record journal entries based on transactions.

## Before you use it

If you are looking for a personal budgeting tool, or a billing software, or CRM, this tool is an overkill because there are other tools that better suit those needs.

## Accounting Talk

Accountants love journal entries, because every financial transaction or manual adjustment at the end is represented by a journal entry. A journal entry is basically a bunch of debits and a bunch of credits, and sum of each must equal each other.

The core of Pacioli revolves around journal entries, and there are only two interfaces for them: Transaction and Adjustment. It is simple because that's how it should be. If you sit back and think about accounting in general, these are the only two things we can do to affect our financial statements.
